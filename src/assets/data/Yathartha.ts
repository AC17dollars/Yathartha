    about : "Yathartha is a big tech fest put together by student groups from Thapathali Campus, with the FSU coordinating everything. It's like a huge stage where young thinkers come together to turn their cool ideas into reality. Imagine the world of school lessons where they talk a lot about how things work. At Yathartha, we're taking a break from the usual routine and getting into the fun side of doing things with your hands. It's a chance to go beyond just reading and really experience how vision can be turned to reality"
